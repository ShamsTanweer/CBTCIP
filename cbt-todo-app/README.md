# To-Do List Application

## Overview

This is a simple and user-friendly To-Do List application built with React. It allows users to add daily tasks, mark them as completed, and view them in separate lists. Completed tasks are displayed in a different list, making it easy to keep track of what has been done.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a title and timestamp.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- View active tasks and completed tasks in separate lists.
- Delete tasks from either the active or completed lists.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
